This Project is an ongoing project in which data is collected from collegedekho.com and the data is then analysed.
# Steps
1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning
3. Data analysis and visualisation

## 1. Data collection
The data for this project is collected using scrapy library in python. Additionally scrapy-rotating-proxies is used along with tor network to randomize the proxy pool and avoid getting banned by the site.
The tor network is accessed by using Docker containers.

## 2. Data cleaning
The data collected from step 1 is in a nested json format. Thus the data needs to be normalized and improved so that the needed analysis can be performed easily.

## 3. Data analysis and visualisation
For this step, the data will be used for answering questions such as:
  a. How are the colleges are spread throughout the country
  b. What are the average cost of study by state and course
  c. What is the Highest and lowest no. of courses offered by colleges of each type college
 
# Conclusion

This is an ongoing project. :sweat_smile:
